# Create your gist and bl.ock

Using the `index.html` and `README.md` files created in the [first exercise](exercise.md), we will create a gist and then we will be able to launch it as a bl.ock. 

1. Sign in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to your [gist home page](https://gist.github.com/).
3. Name the gist and type an optional description and name for your gist.
4. Name the first file as `index.html`.
5. Copy the block of code from the `index.html` file (HTML, CSS and JS) from the first exercise.
6. Click on "Add file".
7. Name the second files as `README.md`.
8. Copy the text from the `README.md` file from the first exercise.
9. Click on "Create public gist".
