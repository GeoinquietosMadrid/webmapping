# Gists & Bl.ocks

## 1. Gists

**Gists** are a great way to share your work. You can share single files, parts of files, or full applications. You can access gists at [https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com).

Every gist is a Git repository, which means that it can be forked and cloned.

### 1.1. Types of gists

There are two types of gists: **public** gists and **secret gists**. Additionally, if you are not logged into GitHub when you create your gist, it will be an anonymous gist.

### 1.2. Creaing a gist

If you are signed in to GitHub when you create a gist, the gist will be associated with your account and you will see it in your list of gists when you navigate to your [gist home page](https://gist.github.com/).

1. Sign in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to your [gist home page](https://gist.github.com/).
3. Gist name descriptionType an optional description and name for your gist.
4. Type the text of your gist into the gist text box. Add as many files as you need.
5. Do one of the following:

  a. To create a public, searchable gist, click **Create public gist**.
  b. Gist create buttonTo create a secret gist that is not searchable by other users, click **Create secret Gist**.

## 2. Bl.ocks

**Bl.ocks** (pronounced “Blocks”) is a simple viewer for sharing code examples hosted on [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/). For example, if your Gist URL is:

[https://gist.github.com/mbostock/1353700](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/1353700)

Replace “gist.github.com” with “bl.ocks.org” in the URL to view it:

[https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1353700](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1353700)

The main source for your example is in `index.html`. This file can contain relative links to other files in your Gist, such as images, scripts or stylesheets. And of course you can use absolute links, such as CDN-hosted D3, jQuery or Leaflet. To explain your example, add a `README.md` written in Markdown. 

For convenient access, install [the browser extension](https://github.com/mbostock/bl.ocks.org/blob/master/README.md) for Chrome or Firefox!
